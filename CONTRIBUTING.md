## Style Guidelines

### Naming Conventions

- **Components**: PascalCase (e.g., `CurrencyCard.vue`)
- **Folders**: kebab-case (e.g., `currency-picker/`)
- **Variables/Functions**: camelCase (e.g., `convertCurrency`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `DEFAULT_CURRENCY`)
- **Database Fields**: snake_case (e.g., `created_at`, `updated_at`)

### TypeScript Guidelines

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good
interface ExchangeRate {
  from_currency: string;
  to_currency: string;
  rate: number;
  updated_at: Date;
}

// ‚ùå Bad
interface ExchangeRate {
  fromCurrency: string;
  toCurrency: string;
  rate: number;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

### Vue Component Structure

```vue
<template>
  <!-- Template content -->
</template>

<script lang="ts">
import Vue from 'nativescript-vue';

export default Vue.extend({
  name: 'ComponentName',
  props: {},
  data() {
    return {};
  },
  computed: {},
  methods: {}
});
</script>

<style scoped lang="scss">
/* Component styles */
</style>
```

### SCSS Guidelines
